			<h1><strong>About me:</strong></h1>
			<p>I grew up in the Maryland suburbs just outside of Washington DC.  My professional career spans sales, business development, and consulting within 3 startups (one of which I co-founded) and 3 tours of duty in large enterprise software companies (Oracle, IBM and SAP).  I love technology and it's ability to improve our lives and the experiences we share with the people we care about.</p>
			<br />
			<h1><strong>Education:</strong></h1>
			<p>I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts Degree in Behavioral and Social Sciences from the University of Maryland College Park.   I'm three courses into the Harvard's Extension School, where I am seeking a Masters of Liberal Arts in Software Engineering.   My goal is to leverage the masters degree to further my career in product management.</p><br />
			<h1><strong>Personal Life:</strong></h1>
			<p>I live in Cambridge, MA and I am married to Jaclyn Grimshaw, who works in management consulting.   We have a beautiful three year old son name Bennett.   He is a smart, creative and rambunctious bundle of energy as well as a source of great joy in our lives.</p>
			<br />
			<h1><strong>Interests:</strong></h1>
			<p>I'm an avid follower of all things related to entrepreneurship.   I previously cofounded an enterprise startup called Cogent Mobile and I'm currently working on a new project on the consumer big data analytics.   I have a broad interest in user experience design of various technology sectors spanning Quantified self, Big Data, SaaS, consumer analytics.   I love working-out as often as I can make it to the gym, and specifically enjoy running and cycling.
